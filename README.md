# Group Project 2

In the second group project for Web Developmnent class, we made a react frontend on top of a RESTful API service. You can try the demo live [here](https://github.com/vefforritun/vef2-2018-h1-synilausn).

***

### Running Locally

Clone the project into a folder. Navigate into the folder, make sure you have Node.js installed, and run `npm install`. Once you've installed all the necessary packages, go ahead and run `npm start` to start the server.

### API connection

The current project is connected to the [API](https://vefforritun2-h1-synilausn.herokuapp.com). In order to set up another API, change the `REACT_APP_SERVICE_URL` variable in the `.env` file.
